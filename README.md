# Tool as help for systematic literature review
This tool is supposed to provide help for systematic literature review
It helps to screen the docments for certain terms
Currently hardcoded for search terms of my masters thesis
Only usable for pdf

# Installation
Install Python 3.6 or higher
Put documents to screen in ./pdf folder
Run main.py

# Notes
PDF in the root folder will be screened too, but this is not recommended.
Do not change the .txt files.

# Known issues
Can get stuck on processing of PDF/A format documents
Categorizes documents with blank first page or special covers as "unsupported"
Clunky and unresponsive UI
